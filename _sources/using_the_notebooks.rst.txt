Using the Jupyter Notebooks
###########################

This is the procudure for downloading and running the Jupyter Notebooks.

Start the Jupyter Notebook, using Anaconda Navigator.  Make a new folder with
the New button at the top left of the Notebook home interface.  Select the new
``Untitled folder`` from the list on the page, so there is a check in the
check box next to it, and choose "Rename" from the top left.  Enter a new name
like `data-analysis`.  Click on this folder to navigate to it in the Jupyter
interface.  Now download the notebook linked at the top of
:doc:`jupyter_intro` to the new ``data-analysis`` folder.  You should see it
appear in the Jupyter interface.  Finally, open the ``jupyter_intro.ipynb``
Notebook by clicking on it in the Jupyter interface.
