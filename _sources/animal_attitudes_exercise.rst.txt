Here we are going to try to analyze the data from this survey:

https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/attitudes-animal-research-2016

You can download the raw data from here:

https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue?sn=8059

To be helpful, I have unpacked the tab-delimited data file for you, and also
converted the data dictionary document to a PDF:

* :download:`tab-delimited data file
  <ols_animal_research_survey_data_2016.tab>`;
* :download:`data dictionary PDF file
  <ols_animal_research_survey_data_2016_ukda_data_dictionary.pdf>`.

Download the data file to the directory containing this Notebook.

    >>> #: Load pandas
    >>> import pandas as pd

.. nbplot::

    >>> #: Read file into data frame
    >>> df = pd.read_table('ols_animal_research_survey_data_2016.tab')

Display the data frame:

    [987 rows x 248 columns]

Show the list of the all the column names:

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- Show the column names

Have a look at the data dictionary.  Find the name of the column containing
the variable with label "Sources of balanced information about use of:
Universities".  Keep a note of that.

Now find the name of the column with label "Sources of balanced information
about use of: Animal protection organisations".  Keep a note of that too.

Use indexing to select make a new data frame containing only these two columns
from the original data frame.  It will look something like ``questions =df[`` followed by
the names of the columns you just found.  Have a look at :doc:`brexit` for
inspiration.

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- Select only the two columns we found above.
    >>> #- Something like
    >>> #- questions = df[ something here ]

Check that your new ``questions`` data frame has the column names you
expected.

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- Show the column names for the new "questions" data frame

Rename the columns to ``"trust_uni"`` and ``"trust_protectors"``.   See
:doc:`brexit` for inspiration.

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- Rename the columns of the new data frame to:
    >>> #- "trust_uni" and "trust_protectors"

.. mpl-interactive::

Import the plotting library, using the same conventions as in :doc:`brexit`:

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- Import the plotting library

Plot a histogram of the values for the question about trusting universities.

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- A histogram of the values for the trust universities question

Plot a histogram of the values for the question about trusting Animal
Protection Organizations:

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- A histogram of the values for the trust APOs question

Do you think there is a substantial difference between these histograms?   How
would you check?

If you have extra time, why not try and find out whether the respondents trust
politicians any better than universities or animal protection organizations.
