title: "Student feedback"

18 students came to the course for all or nearly all the 10 teaching hours.
15 of 18 students filled out the feedback form.  I made the responses
anonymous to give them greater freedom to give negative feedback.

See [^1] for links to the code and data.

for the data and code to generate the figures and free-text reports.  Start at
the `feedback` target in the `Makefile`.

![The main reason I wanted to do this course was](feedback/fb_main_reason.png)

Three students chose "The 100 pound bursary" on this question, of which one
was entirely negative, giving their favorite part of the course (see below) as
"The breaks".  Paying the students does mitigate the tendency for the students
to have prior interest and experience, but students who are doing the course
entirely for the money, may have less motivation to concentrate than would be
the case for a class with credit.

course.](feedback/fb_better_statistics.png)

In the following question - "After the course, I feel more confident about
doing my own data analysis" - I reversed the scale order, so "Disagree" was on
the left and "Agree" was on the right.  I did this to avoid bias, but I
suspect this tripped up several of the students.  For example, one student who
gave a 5 (Agree) to the question above, gave a 1 (Disagree) to the following
question.

understand.](feedback/fb_code_helps.png)

![About the pace of the course, was it:](feedback/fb_pace.png)

The free-text comments below show that a lot of the students wanted more time
to practice writing code.  The only student who answered "I have written a lot
of useful code." to the question "How much computer code have you written?"
gave a 4 on the question about the pace of the course (the course was somewhat
too slow) and offered the free-text suggestion "Make the course a bit faster".
