The course is for 10 hours total over three days.

Unfortunately, we are in different rooms on each day.  It turns out that room
bookings get busy around the beginning of term.

I'm sure y'all know this off by heart, but here is the standard `UoB campus map`_.

* Tuesday September 19th, 10am - 12, 2 - 4pm in `Room 310 Watson Building
  <https://universityofbirmingham.service-now.com/eqpublic/rooms.do?room=c0fd79974d8d6c008163baecd9deaa2d>`_
  (R15);
* Wednesday 20th, 10am - 12 (no afternoon session) in `Room 204, Law Building

Please turn up for 10am on each day, we'll start on time.
